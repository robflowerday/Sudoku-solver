# Suduko-Solver
This program can solve any 9 x 9 suduko and return the solved result to the user.
Please see the code for where to input your chosen suduko.

The program uses logical steps to solve easy sudukos. 
it did not add any significant computation time to use depth first search rather than computation to solve expert level sudokus after the same inital logical steps where used.
